        <h1>This is the image prototype of our project that you are seeing on the keychain.</h1>
        <h2>This project involves designing and fabricating a Captain America–themed keychain that combines aesthetics, mechanical innovation, and digital interactivity.To give the keychain modern functionality, an NFC tag is embedded on the back, programmed to link directly to a functional website created for the project.</h2>
        <h2>This Captain America–style acrylic keychain successfully combines design, mechanical engineering, and smart NFC technology into a single innovative product. The precise CO₂ laser cutting ensures professional aesthetics, while acrylic provides strength and beauty. The NFC tag that links directly to the project’s website gives the keychain functional technological value.Together, these features make the project both impressive and practical—an excellent demonstration of engineering design principles, digital integration, and fabrication technology.</h2>
