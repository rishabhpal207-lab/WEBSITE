        This is the image prototype of our project that you are seeing on the keychain.
    </h2>

    <h2>
        This project involves designing and fabricating a Captain America–themed keychain
        that combines aesthetics, mechanical innovation, and digital interactivity.
        An NFC tag is embedded on the back, programmed to link directly to a functional
        website created for this project.
    </h2>

    <h2>
        The CO₂ laser–cut acrylic structure ensures precision and durability. The integrated
        NFC tag adds modern functionality, making this a blend of engineering, design,
        and smart technology.
